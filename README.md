# COVID-19_Molecular-Docking

This was a script developed while I was partnering with the University of Campinas Brazil as a part of MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI). We coded this script to test a database of 9,000 ligands on the COVID-19 spike protein utilizing the auto-dock Vina software.
